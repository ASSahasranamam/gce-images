Google Compute Engine-optimized Docker images
=============================================

[Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) provides an excellent set of [docker images](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/docker/) containing R, RStudioServer, and the sets of Bioconductor packages appropriate for certain use cases.

Here we have a version of the Bioconductor [Sequencing View](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Sequencing) optimized to run on Google Compute Engine.
