Docker Image Scripts
=============================================

[Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) provides an excellent set of [docker images](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/docker/) containing R, RStudioServer, and the sets of Bioconductor packages appropriate for certain use cases.

Here we have a version of the Bioconductor [Sequencing View](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___Sequencing) which adds on [GoogleGenomics](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GoogleGenomics.html), [bigrquery](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bigrquery/index.html), [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/), and some configuration to .Rprofile.
